Here is the list of my side-projects that I currently maintain.

* [**Remote Office Hours**](https://tik.dev/office-hours) - I did office hours with strangers who needed advice on remote work.
* [**Crontab**](https://crontab.cronhub.io) – A simple cron expression generator.
* [**Booknshelf**](https://booknshelf.com) – Booknshelf is a website to keep track of all your books online.
